> Above all, I hope we don't become missionaries. Don't feel as if you're Bible salesmen. The world has too many of those already. What you know about computing other people will learn. Don't feel as if the key to successful computing is only in your hands. What's in your hands, I think and hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more.

> These skills are by no means unique to computer programming. The techniques we reach and draw upon are common to all of engineering design. We control complexity by building abstractions that hide details when appropriate. We control complexity by establishing conventional interfaces that enable us to construct systems by combining standard, well-understood pieces in a "mix and match" way. We control complexity by establishing new languages for describing a design, each of which emphasizes particular aspects of the design and deemphasizes others.

## 1.1 The Elements of Programming

> Every powerful language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:
> - *primitive expressions*, which represent the simplest entities the language is concerned with,
> - *means of combination*, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and
> - *means of abstraction*, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.
